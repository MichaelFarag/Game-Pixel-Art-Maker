# Udacity-Lab-Pixel-Art-Maker

You create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

To begin, you'll be given starter code (including HTML and CSS) to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
Choose a color.<br>
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.<br>
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
